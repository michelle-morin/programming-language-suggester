# _Programming Language Suggester_

#### _JavaScript & jQuery independent project for Epicodus_, _17 January 2020_

#### By _**Michelle Morin**_

## Description

_This project is a webpage that suggests, based on user responses to survey questions, which programming language the user should learn. The webpage prompts a user to fill out a form, which includes three different form input types (a text input box, select boxes, and radio buttons). After the user answers a series of questions (some related to programming, some arbitrary) and submits the form via a button, the webpage displays a recommendation of a programming language for the user to learn. jQuery is used to obtain the user's name, technical interest, motivation for learning a programming language, and everyday food choice from four of the form inputs. Branching is used to:
* _output a different programming language recommendation for each technical interest option_
* _output a different article for each motivation to learn a programming language_
* _address the user by name or with "Hey there," and_
* _return proper verb tense for a quip regarding the user's food selection._

_Bootstrap version 3.3.7 and a custom stylesheet both style the webpage._
